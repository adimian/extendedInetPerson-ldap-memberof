make sure the ldapi:/// is running as part of the host

'ps aux | grep slapd' should give you something like this
/usr/sbin/slapd -h ldap:/// ldapi:/// -u openldap -g openldap -d 0

it is important, otherwise the ldapadd process is not able to contact ldap

if ldapadd is not a know process, install ldap-utils
